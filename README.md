## üîπ Project Description

The goal of this project is to read, modify, and extract statistics from a local `.csv` database of an inventory of a business. The project allows:

- Reading the CSV file and displaying inventory
- Modifying the inventory: price, quantities, products avaiable
- Generating receipt.
- Log in via an user and password.
- Creation of new users.

## üî∏ Versions

### `v1-original/`
Developed during my first year of university. It uses basic file I/O and manual data parsing techniques.

### `v2-upgrade/`
An upgrade from the original code built from scratch.

- Instead of .csv, it uses SQLite for database management.
- For users, passwords pass through bcrypt. Given the nature of the project, the use of argon2id or scrypt isnt deemed necessary.
- A GUI is implemented, it changes according to the role of the user who logged in.
- Selling products generates a receipt in .txt.
- A graph of revenue per day is shown in statistics.

## üìù Requirements

Python 3.11.9 is required. Previous versions might work for the "v1-original/" version.
