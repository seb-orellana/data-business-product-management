## üî∏ Versions

### `v1-original/`
Developed during my first year of university. It uses basic file I/O and manual data parsing techniques.

### `v2-upgrade/`
A slighly better version of the original code.
The code now uses libraries to enhance use, allowing for the creation of a GUI and a better management of the data.
Furthermmore, the code has been separated in multiple .py to avoid the clutter of lines in a single file.

There are more possible upgrades, however, there are no plans to applying them soon.

## üìù Requirements

Python 3.11.9 is required. Previous versions might work for the "v1-original/" version.
